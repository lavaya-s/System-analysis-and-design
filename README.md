# System-analysis-and-design

#    The client was a instructor based auto school and they wanted to design an online course that provided materials and scheduling system for driving exams. I feel that I communicated the scheduling system well through non-technical and technical communications and UML diagrams. I would improve on the class diagram if I could improve on anything. It felt strange not including the methods but it is understandeable as that would take a lot of time for grading purposes. I may also add more classes. The user is the one utilizing the functions of the system. It is very important to have the system be functional for the user and be intuitive to increase the user base. More users means more customers for the client after all. I like the approach here where the technical requirements servew as a guide to help layout UML diagrams and then you can reinterpret as needed for non-technical audiences.
